# Portfolio design & content

## Overview

Put all the final content, images and design into your portfolio. *The whole website should be done—except for Javascript.* **Make it perfect.**

Some details & things about the website to consider:

- It should be completely responsive between 320px – ~2500px.
- Only real images and real text.
- The design, logos, typography, etc. should be complete.
- **Every single portfolio piece should be final.**<br>If they’re incomplete because you’re still working on them in another class put as much in as absolutely possible.
- Add in all the accessibility features we’ve discussed in the past.
- Performance isn’t too big of a concern—we’ll be spending time on that later. But don’t put massive RAW graphics on your website. I don’t want to have to wait 10 minutes for it to download.
- There should be no broken links anywhere on the website.
- **ABSOLUTELY NO JAVASCRIPT!!**—your site should be fully functional without it, we’ll add it in later.

## Browser testing

In class, week 11, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.
